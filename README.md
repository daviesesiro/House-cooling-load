# Linear Regression Model for Prediction of House Cooling Load

## Question

According to the United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP) Sustainable Buildings and Climate Initiative, construction trade contributes as much as 30% to all global greenhouse gas emissions and consumes up to 40% of all energy used worldwide. Climate change is currently having a powerful impact on how buildings are designed and constructed.
You will develop a multiple regression model to study the effect of eight input variables on one output variable, which is the cooling load of residential buildings. The data provided is from the energy analysis data of 768 different building shapes. The features provided are the relative compactness, surface area, wall area, roof area, overall height, orientation, glazing area and glazing area distribution.

### TO DO

1. Follow the steps for building a linear regression model to build a model that will predict the cooling load of a given house with the given features.
2. For engineering students use tkinter library in python to develop a desktop app for this while computer science students are to deploy this as a web application.

The dataset for the training and evaluation is attached. Drop any column not needed for the regression model
